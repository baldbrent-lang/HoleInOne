"""AI-powered golf analysis. Step 2: find the address frame.

Camera is always behind the golfer; golfer hits toward a target away
from the camera. This module's only job (for now) is to identify the
single frame closest to ADDRESS — the golfer standing over the ball,
club at rest behind/next to the ball, just before takeaway begins.

Future steps will layer in ball-at-rest detection, impact frame, ball
tracking, and the dashed-overlay render — each verified before moving
on. The classical CV tracer in services/tracer.py is independent of
this module.

    "positioned BEHIND the target line, and the golfer is hitting "
    "AWAY from the camera (target is down the image, beyond the "
    "golfer).\n\n"
    "Your only job: determine whether the golfer is RIGHT-handed or "
    "LEFT-handed.\n\n"
    "Reason in this exact order — do NOT skip steps:\n"
    "Step 1. Locate the golfer's HANDS gripping the club. Note their "
    "approximate (x, y) pixel coordinates in the image. (Image "
    "dimensions are given in the user message; x=0 is left, y=0 "
    "is top.)\n"
    "Step 2. Locate the CLUBHEAD resting on the ground at the ball. "
    "Note its approximate (x, y) pixel coordinates.\n"
    "Step 3. Compare: clubhead_x vs hands_x.\n"
    "  - If clubhead_x < hands_x (clubhead is to the LEFT of the "
    "hands in the image), the shaft drops down-and-LEFT, and the "
    "golfer is LEFT-handed.\n"
    "  - If clubhead_x > hands_x (clubhead is to the RIGHT of the "
    "hands in the image), the shaft drops down-and-RIGHT, and the "
    "golfer is RIGHT-handed.\n"
    "This rule holds because the camera sits behind the target line. "
    "A right-handed golfer's clubhead rests in front of his lead "
    "(left) foot on his target side; from a behind-the-line camera "
    "that target side appears on the image-RIGHT, so the clubhead "
    "is RIGHT of the hands and the shaft drops down-and-right. "
    "Left-handed is the mirror.\n\n"
    "Apply the comparison literally. Do NOT second-guess it with "
