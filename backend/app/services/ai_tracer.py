"""AI-powered golf analysis. Step 2: find the address frame.

Camera is always behind the golfer; golfer hits toward a target away
from the camera. This module's only job (for now) is to identify the
single frame closest to ADDRESS — the golfer standing over the ball,
club at rest behind/next to the ball, just before takeaway begins.

Future steps will layer in ball-at-rest detection, impact frame, ball
tracking, and the dashed-overlay render — each verified before moving
on. The classical CV tracer in services/tracer.py is independent of
this module.

    "You are looking at a single still frame of a golfer at ADDRESS — "
    "set up over the ball, just before takeaway. The camera is "

    "AWAY from the camera (target is down the image, beyond the "
    "golfer).\n\n"
    "Your job: locate the golfer's HANDS and the GOLF BALL on the "
    "ground, then determine whether the golfer is RIGHT-handed or "
    "LEFT-handed from the shaft direction between them.\n\n"
    "Reason in this exact order — do NOT skip steps:\n"
    "Step 1. Locate the golfer's HANDS gripping the club (the upper "
    "end of the shaft). Note their approximate (x, y) pixel "
    "coordinates in the image. (Image dimensions are given in the "
    "user message; x=0 is left, y=0 is top.)\n"
    "Step 2. Locate the GOLF BALL on the ground. The ball is whatever "
    "the club shaft is pointing toward — at address the clubhead "
    "rests right against the ball, so the ball is at (or within a "
    "few pixels of) the lower end of the shaft. Report the ball's "
    "approximate (x, y) pixel coordinates. (If the clubhead obscures "
    "the ball, just use the clubhead position; that's the ball "
    "location for our purposes.)\n"
    "Step 3. Compare: ball_x vs hands_x.\n"
    "  - If ball_x < hands_x (ball is to the LEFT of the hands in "
    "the image), the shaft points down-and-LEFT, and the golfer is "
    "LEFT-handed.\n"
    "  - If ball_x > hands_x (ball is to the RIGHT of the hands in "
    "the image), the shaft points down-and-RIGHT, and the golfer is "
    "RIGHT-handed.\n"
    "This rule holds because the camera sits behind the target line. "
    "A right-handed golfer's ball rests in front of his lead (left) "
    "foot on his target side; from a behind-the-line camera that "
    "target side appears on the image-RIGHT, so the ball is RIGHT of "
    "the hands and the shaft points down-and-right. Left-handed is "
    "the mirror.\n\n"

    Two-phase strategy:
      Phase 1 — fan out up to `max_frames` parallel Claude calls, each
        asking for the ball's pixel coordinates on one frame. If the
        ball's at-rest position from address is supplied via
        ball_xy_sent + ball_sent_dims, it's passed as an initial hint
        (helpful on the first few frames where the ball is still near
        rest).
      Phase 2 — for every frame Claude couldn't find, look at the
        nearest neighbor where it WAS found. Re-query that frame in
        parallel with the neighbor position as a "look near here"
        hint. The ball doesn't move much frame-to-frame, so a rough
        anchor usually rescues a missed call.

    Every frame in the window gets a JPEG written to
    `output_dir / {output_prefix}_f{N}.jpg` — annotated with a yellow
    highlight ring when Claude found the ball, plain otherwise — so
    the operator can see exactly what was queried.
